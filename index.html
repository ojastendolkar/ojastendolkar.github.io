				Interesting experiences: One unique experience/experiences that I've had is that I've been to a trailblazers playoff game 
					every year that they've won a series in the last 10 years. I'm a big blazers fan, and I'd like to think my attendence 						is a lucky charm since they win everytime I attend.
